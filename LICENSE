None of us are lawyers, but to my understanding...

Being a decompilation, much of CSE2's code belongs to Daisuke "Pixel" Amaya.
There was no licence supplied with the original freeware release, so presumably
this code defaults to 'All Rights Reserved'.

...I dunno - how many of *you* are fluent in international copyright law?

Currently we don't have a licence for our code. But, considering CSE2 is
intended for modders, you can probably get away with using it for that without
any of us getting mad over it.

It might be worth crediting us, just to be safe - I (Clownacy) don't mind, but
GabrielRavier does.

# CSE2-

The SADX of CSE2, it's CSE2-!

# Compilation

It's the same as regular CSE2, except the only supported backend is SDL2 texture.

# Probably legal stuff

This doesn't use any code from CS+, this is completely clean room based off of my own examinations.

This repo also does not provide any CS+ assets, and I am not responsible for how users obtain them (Preferably, they would get it from their own purchased copy).

Furthermore, this project isn't intended to take sales or anything from CS+, it's just to have some CS+ style stuff open source for people to use. Once again, you do need the CS+ data folder in order to use this. It's likely that if someone has this they've either bought the game or pirated it anyways.
